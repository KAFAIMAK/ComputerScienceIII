# Course Overview

Computer Science is not just about programming. It is the
mathematical modeling and study of what computation is--what problems
have a computational solution and how efficient that solution can be.
Thus, a strong foundation in mathematics is essential to your success as
a computer scientist. At the heart of computer science are fundamental,
discrete structures which we will study in this course. Specifically,
you will learn many of the mathematical definitions, techniques, and
ways of thinking that will be useful in Computer Science.

## Topics & Schedule

See Canvas

# Course Delivery

This course is delivered in an asynchronous *hybrid* manner:

-   Live lectures are livestreamed via YouTube
    (<https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisBourkeUNL/live>) during the
    regular class time.  

    -   Recordings of the lectures will be available immediately
        following so you can watch/rewatch at your convenience

    -   During the livestream, Piazza will be used for
        questions/answers in addition to in-person questions

-   Written solutions must be submitted through canvas as PDF files,
    no hardcopies will be accepted

-   Office hours will be held online via zoom

## COVID Considerations

Out of respect for faculty and staff, out of respect for the
Learning Assistants, and out of respect for your fellow students
and most especially yourself, you should make sure you are fully
vaccinated if you plan to attend lecture in person.  Several
vaccines are widely available, highly effective and backed by
sound science.  The good majority of adults have
been vaccinated and you should be one of them.  UNL has provided
opportunities to receive a vaccine (free of charge); please consider doing this
as soon as possible.  More information can be found here:
https://covid19.unl.edu/vaccination-information.

Everyone is required and expected to follow all health and safety
guidelines published by the CDC, healthcare officials and the
University of Nebraska--Lincoln.  If you are not fully vaccinated and
still decide to attend in-person lecture, lab or hack sessions,
you will be ***required*** to wear a mask.  If you are fully
vaccinated, you are still **strongly recommended** to wear a mask
given the limited social distancing and disappointingly low
vaccination rates among college age groups in Nebraska.  

If you feel ill or have had exposure to COVID-19, you
**should not attend in-person** and instead utilize the online
opportunities we have provided.  Those who violate the testing
policies or receive a positive test may not be granted access to
University buildings and so you may need to attend remotely.  Getting
vaccinated as soon as you can greatly improves not only your health
risks but also greatly reduces the chance that your access will be
restricted.  

# Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as
possible. If you anticipate or experience barriers based on your
disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical
conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can discuss
options privately. To establish reasonable accommodations, I may request
that you register with Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD). If
you are eligible for services and register with their office, make
arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations
so they can be implemented in a timely manner. SSD contact information:
117 Louise Pound Hall.; 402-472-3787

# Grading

Grading will be based on assignments (both written and programming
portions).


|  Category           | Number | Points Each | Total |
|  -------------------|--------|-------------|-------|
|  Assignments        |     10 |         100 |  1,000|
|  Total              |        |             |  1,000|


## Scale

Final letter grades will be awarded based on the following standard
scale. This scale may be adjusted upwards if the instructor deems it
necessary based on the final grades only. No scale will be made for
individual assignments or exams.

| Letter Grade | Percent |
|--------------|---------|
| A+           | >= 97%  |
| A            | >= 93%  |
| A-           | >= 90%  |
| B+           | >= 87%  |
| B            | >= 83%  |
| B-           | >= 80%  |
| C+           | >= 77%  |
| C            | >= 73%  |
| C-           | >= 70%  |
| D+           | >= 67%  |
| D            | >= 63%  |
| D-           | >= 60%  |
| F            | < 60%   |


## Assignments

The majority of assessment will be based on a series of assignments
that consist of both written exercises
as well as *substantial* programming problems. You will be expected to
follow all instructions on the assignments. Clarity and legibility are
of great importance. If homework is sloppy or unclear, points may be
deducted. You are not required to typeset your written solutions;
however, it is strongly recommended that you do so using LaTeX, markdown
or similar typesetting system. Resources for LaTeX are available on the
course web page. Source code and all relevant files for programming
portions must be handed in using the CSE web handin program. Each
assignment will have a fixed deadline based on CSE's server time. No
late assignments will be accepted.

Further, programming solutions will be graded using our online webgrader
system. Failure to submit compilable or runnable code may result in a
zero. You are expected to do your own substantial testing (and to submit
valid, working test cases as well), but it is essential that your
submissions work on the webgrader.

## Exams

There will be no exams for this course.  The weekly assignments are
challenging and substantial and are a much better assessment of your
ability to learn the material than summative exams.

## Grading Policy

If you have questions about grading or believe that points were deducted
unfairly, you must first address the issue with the individual who
graded it to see if it can be resolved. Such questions should be made
within a reasonable amount of time after the graded assignment has been
returned. No further consideration will be given to any assignment a
week after it grades have been posted. It is important to emphasize that
the goal of grading is consistency. A grade on any given assignment,
even if it is low for the entire class, should not matter that much.
Rather, students who do comparable work should receive comparable grades
(see the subsection on the scale used for this course).

## Late Work Policy

In general, there will be no make-up exams or late work accepted.
Exceptions may be made in certain circumstances such as health or
emergency, but you must make every effort to get prior permission.
Documentation may also be required.

Homework assignments have a strict due date/time as defined by the CSE
server's system clock. All program files must be handed in using CSE's
webhandin as specified in individual assignment handouts. Programs that
are even a few seconds past the due date/time will be considered late
and you will be locked out of handing anything in after that time.

## Webgrader Policy

Failure to adhere to the requirements of an assignment in such a manner
that makes it impossible to grade your program via the webgrader means
that a disproportionate amount of time would be spent evaluating your
assignment. For this reason, we will not grade any assignment that does
not compile and run through the webgrader.

## Academic Integrity

All homework assignments, programs, and exams must represent your own
work unless otherwise stated. No collaboration with fellow students,
past or current, is allowed unless otherwise permitted on specific
assignments or problems. The Department of Computer Science &
Engineering has an Academic Integrity Policy. All students enrolled in
any computer science course are bound by this policy. You are expected
to read, understand, and follow this policy. Violations will be dealt
with on a case by case basis and may result in a failing assignment or a
failing grade for the course itself. The most recent version of the
Academic Integrity Policy can be found at
<http://cse.unl.edu/academic-integrity>

# Honors Section

As an honors course there are several differences with the other
sections.

-  Enrollment is much smaller and therefore there may not be a dedicated
   teaching assistant.

-  There is no recitation session.  In the main section, an additional
   weekly recitation session is held giving an opportunity for more
   practice with the course material and supplemental instruction.  As
   an honors student it will be your responsibility to supplement the
   course material on your own as needed.

-  We will cover topics at a slightly greater pace so that we can cover
   some advanced topics throughout the semester.  

# Communication & Getting Help

The primary means of communication for this course is Piazza, an online
forum system designed for college courses. We have established a Piazza
group for this course and you should have received an invitation to
join. If you have not, contact the instructor immediately. With Piazza
you can ask questions anonymously, remain anonymous to your classmates,
or choose to be identified. Using this open forum system the entire
class benefits from the instructor and TA responses. In addition, you
and other students can also answer each other's questions (again you may
choose to remain anonymous or identify yourself to the instructors or
everyone). You may still email the instructor or TAs, but more than
likely you will be redirected to Piazza for help.

In addition, there are two anonymous suggestion boxes that you may use
to voice your concerns about any problems in the course if you do not
wish to be identified. My personal box is available at
<https://cse.unl.edu/~cbourke/email/>. The department also maintains an
anonymous suggestion box available at
<https://cse.unl.edu/contact-form>.

## Getting Help

Your success in this course is ultimately your responsibility. Your
success in this course depends on how well you utilize the opportunities
and resources that we provide. There are numerous outlets for learning
the material and getting help in this course:

-   Lectures: attend lectures regularly and when you do use the time
    appropriately. Do not distract yourself with social media or other
    time wasters. Actively take notes (electronic or hand written). It
    is well-documented that good note taking directly leads to
    understanding and retention of concepts.

-   Piazza: if you have questions ask them on Piazza. It is the best and
    likely fastest way to get help with your questions. Also, be sure to
    read other student's posts and questions and feel free to answer
    yourself!

-   Office Hours: the instructor holds regular office hours
    throughout the week as posted on the course website. Attend office
    hours if you have questions or want to review material.

-   Don't procrastinate. The biggest reason students fail this course is
    because they do not give themselves enough opportunities to learn
    the material. Don't wait to the last minute to start your
    assignments. Many people wait to the last minute and flood the TAs
    and SRC, making it difficult to get help as the due date approaches.
    Don't underestimate how much time your assignment(s) will take and
    don't wait to the week before hand to get started. Ideally, you
    should be working on the problems as we are covering them.

-   Get help in the *right way*: when you go to the instructor or TA for
    help, you must demonstrate that you have put forth a good faith
    effort toward understanding the material. Asking questions that
    clearly indicate you have failed to read the required material, have
    not been attending lecture, etc. is *not acceptable*. Don't ask
    generic questions like "I'm lost, I don't know what I'm doing".
    Instead, explain what you have tried so far. Explain why you think
    what you have tried doesn't seem to be working. Then the TA will
    have an easier time to help you identify misconceptions or problems.
    This is known as "Rubber Duck Debugging" where in if you try to
    explain a problem to someone (or, lacking a live person, a rubber
    duck), then you can usually identify the problem yourself. Or, at
    the very least, get some insight as to what might be wrong.
