# Computer Science III
### `run.sh` Script Examples

Generally this course's programming exercises are *language agnostic*.
They are designed for generic input and your program(s) must
parse/process the input.  You are ***highly encouraged*** to solve
these exercises in a language you are not already familiar with so as
to use this as an opportunity to expand your toolbox.  The vast 
majority of students choose to use Python 3.

To facilitate the use of any language, you are required to provide 
a `run.sh` script file that contains the commands to compile and 
execute your program as well as pass any command line arguments 
on to your program.  This will enable us to run your program on
the CSE server.  This repository provides examples of `run.sh` 
scripts for several major languages.  A basic "hello world" program
has been included to demonstrate usage.
