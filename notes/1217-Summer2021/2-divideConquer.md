### Divide & Conquer Algorithms

### Introduction

* Divide a problem into smaller problems
* Until the problem is easily or trivially solved (base case)
* You may then need to combine sub-solutions to produce a solution the larger problem
* Usually such approaches are presented as recursive, but they don't have to be
* Well-suited for parallelization and distribute computing
  * MapReduce
  * Searching & Sorting
  * Tournament style strategies
