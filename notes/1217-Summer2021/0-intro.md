# Review & Motivating Example

* Problem:
  * Given: a collection of points in the cartesian plane
  * Output: the minimal distance between any two points

* Algorithm Analysis:
  1. Identify the input
  2. Identify the input size
  3. You identify the *elementary operation*
  4. Analyze how many times the the elementary operation executes with respect to the input size *n*
  5. Provide a Big-O (or Big Theta) analysis of the algorithm
